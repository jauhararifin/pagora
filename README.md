# Pagora

Pagora is a toy programming language inspired from Pascal, Go, and Rust, hence the name. For now, it can run a simple tetris and conway game of life.

This programming language is work in progress.

Currently, it is interpreted in browser using javascript, but I'm planning to compile it to WASM in the future.
